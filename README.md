## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

## Configuration

### Translation Setup

The nutrition calculator uses LibreTranslate API for recipe translations. To set it up:

1. Visit [LibreTranslate](https://libretranslate.com/) and create an account
2. Get a free API key from the LibreTranslate dashboard
3. Add these variables to your `.env` file:
   ```
   LIBRETRANSLATE_URL=https://libretranslate.com
   LIBRETRANSLATE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

Alternatively, you can [self-host LibreTranslate](https://github.com/LibreTranslate/LibreTranslate) on your own server for unlimited translation without API key requirements. In this case, update the URL:
```
LIBRETRANSLATE_URL=http://your-server-address:5000
```

### Spoonacular API

The nutrition calculator and meal planner use Spoonacular API for recipe data:

1. Create an account at [Spoonacular Food API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api)
2. Get your API key from the dashboard
3. Add the API key to your `.env` file:
   ```
   SPOONACULAR_API_KEY=your_spoonacular_api_key_here
