# Admin Panel Tests

This directory contains tests for the admin panel functionality of the Laravel Blog application.

## Test Files

### Basic Admin Tests
- `AdminTest.php` - General tests for admin panel routes and access control
- `Admin/AdminMiddlewareTest.php` - Tests specifically for the admin middleware
- `Livewire/Admin/BasicAdminComponentsTest.php` - Tests that verify all admin Livewire components can be rendered

### Detailed Component Tests
These tests require additional configuration and may need adjustments to match the actual component implementations:
- `Livewire/Admin/PostsTest.php` - Tests for the Posts management components
- `Livewire/Admin/CategoriesTest.php` - Tests for the Categories management components
- `Livewire/Admin/UsersTest.php` - Tests for the Users management components
- `Livewire/Admin/DashboardTest.php` - Tests for the Dashboard component

## Test Coverage

The test suite covers:
1. **Access Control**
   - Admin users can access admin routes
   - Regular users cannot access admin routes
   - Guests cannot access admin routes
   - Middleware correctly checks user roles

2. **Route Testing**
   - All major admin routes are accessible
   - Proper redirects for unauthorized access

3. **Component Testing**
   - All admin Livewire components can be rendered
   - Basic component functionality tests

## Running Tests

To run all admin tests:
```bash
php artisan test tests/Feature/Admin/ tests/Feature/Livewire/Admin/ tests/Feature/AdminTest.php
```

To run just the basic admin tests (more reliable):
```bash
php artisan test tests/Feature/Admin/AdminMiddlewareTest.php tests/Feature/AdminTest.php tests/Feature/Livewire/Admin/BasicAdminComponentsTest.php
```

## Known Issues

1. Some detailed component tests fail due to:
   - Missing GD extension for image testing
   - Differences in component property naming
   - Not all components are fully testable without mocking dependencies

2. Workarounds:
   - The admin approval test is skipped due to emailService dependency
   - Some assertMethodWired methods are not compatible with the current Livewire version

## Future Improvements

1. Add more comprehensive tests for specific CRUD operations
2. Improve mocking of dependencies like emailService
3. Better test data factories for admin-specific models
4. More granular permission testing
